# AEM Orchestrator - Integration Test Scenarios

This is a document to be used as a template for manually integration testing that the AEM Orchestrator application. To use, simply make a copy of this mark down file and add test results to the copy forming a test report.

## Scenario 1: Stack Startup
Ensure the stack is in a healthy state upon startup.

### Prerequisites 
AEM Stack was initially created and no further interaction has occured. The AEM Orchestrator is in a running state and has completed processing all messages on the SQS queue (queue should be empty).

## Scenario 11: Terminate AEM Orchestrator and All Instances
Ensure the AEM Orchestrator can recover from the termination of all Author Dispatcher, Publish and Publish Dispatcher instances from a shutdown state.

### Prerequisites
AEM stack was already in a healthy state and at least one Author, Publish and Publish Dispatcher instance is running. The AEM Orchestrator is running.

### Steps
1. Record the number of Author, Publish and Publish Dispatcher instances
2. Shut down the AEM Orchestrator
2. Terminate all Author, Publish and Publish Dispatcher instances
3. Start the AEM Orchestrator
3. Wait for SQS queue to empty
